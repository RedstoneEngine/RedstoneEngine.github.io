All of the unique behaviors, organisms, and mechanisms working together to create a working collective is so interesting to watch, figure out, and explore different ways to work with/against!"
,,,,,"To start off this topic, I believe a deep look at ecosystems can spark the best new creative solutions. This is best explained in the MIT article Extraterrestrial Engineering which actually first helped me describe my fascination with ecosystems! It goes over a course where students are tasked to create engineering projects for an environment and users which are completely alien to ourselves and Earth, forcing them to work outside the box! An example I've found of using this thought process in action in the real world is in the study of Swarm Robotics! Oftentimes, the best solutions have involved studying patterns of nature's best communicators like ants and bees who use their environment and odd communication patterns to work together! This is a topic I've researched several times throughout my school career which I'll include a link to my favorite research paper on the subject!"
,,,,,"However, ecosystems aren't all just about a creativity exercise. Ecosystems are also ideal for media to help with immersion. This deep dive into an alien or unknown ecosystem brings the user into this place separate from their own as a form of entertainment through escapism. My personal recommendation of a great example includes the TV show Scavengers Reign! Scavengers Reign represents the different clashes and balance a unique ecosystem has as 4 people are dropped on this alien planet as the show challenges the character's traits and conflicts with this new world and the consequences of disrupting said balance. (I've linked the free-to-view, short prequel animation but definitely look online for the full series!)"
,,,,,"Finally, I want to bring up that ecosystems not only bring with it better immersion but also help a world feel alive! I've seen many examples of people playing games and the immersion feeling immediately broken by seemingly having the world revolve only around the player. While some games do well with this player-centric view, I believe others could go far by just adding a bit more of an ecosystem to make the world feel ALIVE and working even without you present. Some of my personal recommendations include making organisms not just have a combined trait but individualistic traits like maybe some enemies move differently or are pacifists, or you could have organisms have certain tasks they do when they're not attacking instead of just simply scouting which could even help the player learn how to interact and better live in this world. (All ideas I had for the game Scrap Mechanic! 😅)"
,,,,,"However, a common example of a good game ecosystem I hear is of Rain World and while its ecosystem does make it feel alive with its physics-based monsters that can attack each other and learn from the player's behaviors, I want to instead shed a light on a YouTube video I keep on going back to of an exploration of adding an ecosystem to my beloved game of Minecraft. This video-! This is a great example of what many video game worlds lack and creates a layer that the animals aren't just there for you but also live in this world and you must learn how to live with them to survive in a symbiotic relationship, and I think that completes that missing ""feeling alive"" connection that the Minecraft world can sometimes miss!"
,,,,,"Overall, I just absolutely adore the concept of otherworldly ecosystems and even the intricate ones on Earth and how those dynamics can shape the organisms, their traits, and their interaction with the player and I could just talk on and on... But I hope I've shared as much as I can about this fascinating topic in as short of an article as I could muster as I have other things on this website to talk about! (Plz email me any media/game/book/online class recs for the intersection of game development and ecosystems!)"
