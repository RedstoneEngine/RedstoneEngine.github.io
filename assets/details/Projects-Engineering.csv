Sprinkler System for Fire Hydrants,Spring 2025,,,local,"For my Senior Design Project class, we worked for Make It Rain Wildfire to improve upon and invent new systems for an emergency sprinkler system attached to fire hydrants. The goal of this system was to prevent flying embers from wildfires igniting someone's property!",Make It Rain Wildfire=https://www.makeitrainwildfire.com/
,,,,,"This project also included research into the legality, ease of use, installation cost, water usage, and deformation for these systems. A lot for one semester but we were able to pull it all together in the end and develop a new device to attach onto theirs. Our idea was a long-distance remote-controlled valve system that allows for both less manpower to enable/disable these systems and the reduction of water usage due to the electronic system able to now have a timer that can turn the system on and off when the ground is damp enough. We went out to test our design but the water pressure was much higher than anticipated which broke the valve we bought. An unsuccessful test but definitely hoping that all our research and design ideas can go forward into a next iteration allowing this potentially property saving system to be used in devastating wildfires.",
Automatic Can Opener,Spring 2025,,,local,"For my Robot Mechanism Design class, we had to design a complex robot utilizing some of the aspects discussed in class like mechanical advantage and 4 bar systems. For our project, we chose to make an automatic can opener that will rotate the can while using a blade to slowly cut the top off of the can. While the project initially seemed simple, we ended up having to change our designs multiple times due to pushback from the teaching team which ultimately ended up with us going back to our original idea.",
,,,,,"The idea we settled with is using a manually-controlled reverse break-drum clamp to grab the can while it is rotated using a simple gear system. While rotating, the top of the can will be cut using a slider crank that pushes a blade periodically into the can. I wish we didn't get as much pushback during the design phase so we had more time to make more prototypes to test the period of cutting and cutting more towards the top of the can to reduce deformation issues. We also could've made it work for any size cans which was the original goal.",
Talons of Acquisition,2021 - 2025,,,local,"In the Robotics & Automation Society (RAS), I participated in the Demobots subcommittee where we create multiple subteams to create our own robots to demonstrate during robotics events like UT's STEM Girl Day! My subteam that I headed, Talons of Acquisition (TOA), had the goal of making a simple claw machine meant to be modularized and improved throughout its lifetime.",
,,,,,"This robot unfortunately has taken the longest to make simply due to the nature of the subcommittee being low-commitment, however, it has been the most fun as I've got to meet so many cool and unique friends throughout my 4 years on the team! I ended up being the main mechanical engineer designing and manufacturing a lot of the subsystems pictured. Before I left, we had begun work on some of the electrical and software aspects of the design and hope to keep in contact with the team past graduation! I also can't wait to see the design fully finished and demonstrated to inspire other students and youth!",
Texas Robo Rumble,Spring 2024,,,local,"I signed up for a Battle Bots competition! You heard that right! Within a couple months, we had to design, build, and battle our own bots in a double-elimination bracket.",
,,,,,I was the main one on CAD and designed the body of the bot. A couple design factors I thought crucial for the body is: 1. Being able to be flipped over which is why the body isn't that tall so the wheels could stick out on either side and 2. Having a secondary offense mechanism of a ramp.,
,,,,,"One of the most difficult parts was getting the weapon machined as MechE's Machine Shop Staff was incredibly unhelpful however someone from Texas Inventionworks helped us out. Unfortunately, our motor ended up being flipped for the weapon which caused it to self-destruct. HOWEVER, my ramp design worked, and we won a battle while we fixed our main weapon. We ended up winning 5th overall! My next semester we ended up building the same robot for our Design Methodology class and did a lot of improvements and analysis to the design.",
RC Race Car,Spring 2024,,,local,"For my Machine Elements class, our task was to design, test, and race an RC car. This proved to be quite the challenge due to us having to design a gearbox and turning mechanism from scratch with little help from the professor and TAs.",
,,,,,"After a lot of research and prototyping we were able to come up with the design shown here. As this class also discussed deflection and fatigue, we did an FEA analysis both for the axle and upon impact as well as hand calculations for different stress conditions.",
,,,,,"From our analysis results and not wanting to damage our steering mechanism, we added a front ramming bar to protect ourselves. Unfortunately, during competition our servo horn got stripped and we had to quickly replace it but we could only turn right which was the opposite way of the track. Shows how important quality assurance is and how to design a better steering mechanism for next time!",
Carlos: The 6-Legged Rover,Spring 2022,,,local,"One day I decided, today I'm going to build my own robot and so I did! I was inspired by the K'NEX Spider Bot toy I has as a child and wanted to recreate it using the lasercutters and printers I was now trained for at Texas Inventionworks.",K'NEX Spider Bot=https://shop.knexusergroup.org.uk/products/71050
,,,,,"I modeled it in Fusion360 as it's the CAD software I was most familar with at the time and then built and assembled it within the span of a semester. The thing I unnexpectedly had the most trouble with was the servos as I accidentally bought limited 180° servos, so I had to take them apart and unattach the potentiometer.",
,,,,,"After building it, I showed to my friends to see how they would respond to it as I had put two sound sensors on the front but the robot ended up being too loud and too slow for the sounds sensors to do anything. Next time could be interesting to try it with distance sensors and have it stop every couple seconds to sense motion and move towards it.

Supernova Fidget Spinner,Fall 2021,,,,"For one of my first classes in university, I was tasked with designing, fabricating, and making a full report for a fidget spinner project. This involved sending sketches, bill of materials, conducting an FEA analysis of a drop test, and setting up a CAM operation to create a mold for the fidget spinners.",
,,,,,"For the designing of the Fidget Spinner, I was tasked with learning and using Solidworks which deemed to be a lot more challenging than anticipated with the organic shape I had in mind. The sketches and FEA tests were done in Solidworks with the CAM setup being done in Fusion360.",
,,,,,The central piece was 3D printed and friction fit with the main body being made using injection molding. It suprisingly turned out exactly how I planned and I never had to sacrifice the design due to it being too complicated for any of the processes the assignments asked for.,
