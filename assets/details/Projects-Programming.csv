Modding Games,2025 - Present,,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/09OCAMJt05M,"Lately, I've stumbled head-first into the world of modding my favorite games! It started very simple, using Minecraft's built in commands system to create whole new game mechanics, and when that wasn't enough, going straight into injecting Java code to make some pretty cool new features!",
,,,,,"The process of modding is quite interesting being able to inject code at the beginning or end of methods to change the direction and underlining mathematics to change the outcome of the game. It definitely helped having a good grasp of how game engines and games work to begin with, and I moved on to modifying more aspects of games. For example, adding a mod to the new game PEAK that adds a whole new class system of HUNTERS vs CLIMBERS with the goal being to see if the Climbers can reach the top before the Hunters stop them! Overall, this has been a very worth it journey and can't wait to see what's next!",
Food Truck Website,Fall 2023,Website,https://www.montysfoodtruck.com/,,"For Christmas, I designed and created a website for my dad's business! He runs a food truck that serves hot sandwiches, and I wanted to help him out in his dream of running his own business and being a chef. (His food is already top notch!) Check out his Facebook to see where he's headed!",
,,,,,"I've experimented several times with website development before with Conquer the Tree and the Virtual Robot Simulator as well as having experience designing an interactive and intuitive user interface, so I figured I could secretly make a well function website as his Christmas Gift! It turned out really well only having to go through a couple design changes to make some systems simplier or reformat how some items are displayed. I would definitely do this again and make for example my own website as I've done here!",
Jumble Jam Games,Fall 2023,,https://egads-austin.itch.io/2023-jumble-jam-games,,"The Jumble Jam Game Jam was quite an interesting game jam concept where you work on 3 games across 24 hours each as the game gets sent over to the next team. Unfortunately, the next 2 games we were sent were 3D games meaning it was mainly me able to work on the game and the games also had no clear vision, so... I present to you 3 whole game ideas I designed and made within 72 hours!",
,,,,,Penguin Fight is an interesting take on a rhythm fighting game where each move is given rhythmically in the song and then executed on by the enemy in this case Obi-Wan! Penguin Finder was very much open sandbox for us in terms of you had to find and return 5 different penguin statues. My favorite room is the dark room where you have to use a scanning feature like in the game Scanner Sombre. The third game is Save the Penguins! where you must guide the penguins to a safe shelter before the storm but the penguins have a bit of a mind of their own and the terrain is very slippery!,Scanner Sombre=https://store.steampowered.com/app/475190/Scanner_Sombre/
Texas Game Jam Games,2021 - 2024,,,,The Texas Game Jam is a jam I've competed in every year at UT. It's hosted by the Electronic Game Developer Society (EGaDS) and is a whole lot of fun each time! It's great working with a team of very talented people to be able to pull off an interesting game within 24 hours!,
,,,,,"The first year we made Vertices and Pi in Unity which contains a collection of cool minigames all tied up in a sweet story, second year we got a bit too ambitious by trying to make a 3D Unreal game which didn't get fully finished, third year we went with Godot and made Rat-Tide Skirmish which is a 2 vs. 2 fighting game where you throw traps at each other and run along the walls, and finally the forth year we went back to Unity and made Tango to the End of Time which is an extremely challenging physics-based timing game where you have to catapult yourself around planets to the end. Overall, super fun and exciting working on these great small games! Will jam with some of the people I've worked with again!",Vertices and Pi=https://insighted.itch.io/vertices-and-pi / Rat-Tide Skirmish=https://redengdeveloper.itch.io/rat-tide-skirmish / Tango to the End of Time=https://redengdeveloper.itch.io/tango-to-the-end-of-time
Virtual Robot Simulator,2021 - 2025,Full Releases / Website / Learning,https://robotimporter.vrobotsim.online/homepage.html,https://www.youtube.com/embed/HvywykxdrBU?list=PLszFVnnZcmarYReNB-qCSZLiu2l3Mvlvz,"The Virtual Robot Simulator is a program that I have worked on for a while. It originally started as a personal project to bring the experience of the robotics competition FTC to a virtual environment during Covid times, however, a respresentative from FTC was making their own simulator and asked me to join the team after seeing my skills and initiative!",
,,,,,"The Virtual Robot Simulator hopes to provide a simulator to those teams in FTC and inspired elementary students who wish to experience the world of robotics! Because of this, we offer the ability to program using Blocks and Java, the ability to start a multiplayer competition between others, lessons ranging from beginner to advanced topics, and the ability to import your own robots that have been made through a CAD software which I have been in charge of designing and creating! I've also worked a lot on the visual design and ensuring a smooth user experience for new users. Overall, a very rewarding experience as the problems are complicated, the user experience is important, and the program has had an active positive impact for many users and elementary schools!",
Plants vs. Zombies AR,Summer 2021,ARVR,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/rU2_OTNgbO0?start=308,"My next augmented reality project, Plants vs. Zombies! I was inspired by seeing my favorite games be turned into AR projects like Five Nights at Freddy's and Minecraft and while both projects unfortunately failed, it gave me a lot of ideas on how to fix them and made me realize the perfect franchise to take up the mantel as the next Pokemon Go phenomenon!",
,,,,,"A Plants vs. Zombies augmented reality game mostly speaks for itself, but some extra cool features involve adding a multiplayer feature where you and others can all defend the same lawn against a ZOMBOSS, having to travel to certain biomes around your neighborhood to get special plants, and having custom AR minigames like the first Plants vs. Zombies game that utilizes the new tech. While I already made a demo, I kind of want to make a more fleshed out demo and play in a multiplayer Zomboss battle for the fun of it!",
FTC Autonomous Program,2020 - 2021,,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/oeSi75TZSuo,"For my journey in the FIRST Tech Challenge, I have to show off the amount of prototyping and calculations I did to make the ""ultimate"" autonomous program! This challenge involved a 30 second time period to score the most points possible with a 2 vs. 2 team.",
,,,,,"I implemented a system that would take in coordinate points for the robot to go along a designated path that would dynamically change based on system parameters and the randomization of the field. This was checked using encoder wheels, distance sensors, and an Intertial Measurement Unit (IMU) which can be seen in the first picture. I then implemented 2 systems for the drivers including wheel locking so we wouldn't be pushed while launching rings and an automatic alignment and correct power set to launch the rings reliably into the top goal! Overall, a very fun programming challenge that combined both of my favorite subjects!",
Villain REWIND,2020 - 2022,Full Releases / Unreal Engine,https://redengdeveloper.itch.io/villain-rewind-demo,local,"Another game that originally started as a game jam, but turns out became really fun to play, Villain REWIND! I played this game a lot in my classes during quarantine to pass the time once assignments were done.",
,,,,,"In this game, you must continuously reach the end of the same room as you are rewound back, however, the position of the player is tracked every run and, in beat with the song, a trap will be placed where the player has been before which makes the player not be able to take the same path twice and will lead to eventual chaos with traps down every single path. This game requires a lot of quick thinking and has been very fun to try and beat on my ""impossible"" mode where the time to get through the room each time is very small and the amount of times you have to run through is very large. I've enjoyed it so much and have been inspired by a Gooseworx song to make a bigger release of it on the fabled Unreal Engine!",
Conquer the Tree,2019 - 2020,Full Releases / Website,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZyUpILygi1E,The game Conquer the Tree I originally won as part of a Game Jam contest! The company offered to publish a fully finished version of my game on their website so I went straight to work. This specific company's platform allows a multiplayer couch experience where you can control the game through players' phones which I thought was a cool concept!,
,,,,,"The game involves a dynamically created board based on a growing tree where you must be the first to eat leaves and acorns to earn points! The only way to be the first one to move is by moving the least amount of spaces per round which makes it an interesting game dynamic. For the full game, powerups and minigames were included that resemble classic games like snake, whac-a-mole, and a few originals like an acorn launching game. It has also gone through a couple publishing platforms as the original platform vanished and the previous one became corporate and booted multiple indie games, so eventually I hope to publish it again using my own technology to host it!",
Space Fighters,Spring 2019,Full Releases,https://redengdeveloper.itch.io/space-fighters,https://www.youtube.com/embed/zSn4BTo6eGw,"Space Fighters! My first experience in the top down shooter variety as well as in the multiplayer games sphere which was the main motivation for designing the game! I wanted to design a game that was both cooperative as well as competitive where both players' goal is to collect resources, defeat waves of enemies, and finally defeat a random boss.",
,,,,,"I learned a lot from this game specifically in what types of game experiences I deeply enjoy creating. I liked having a multiplayer aspect to where I could play and have fun with my friends and hopefully be able to see others having fun in an experience I had created. It also showed me that I liked creating different enemy AI. It's a weird combination of putting yourself in the enemies perspective and throwing everything you got at them while having the player figure out their patterns and weaknesses to be able to take out the enemy while not making it seem like the game revolves around the player in a type of ecosystem. I may come back to the game to this game at some point, especially since I made a crab-based version of this game for one of my classes recently!",
