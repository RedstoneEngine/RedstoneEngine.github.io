                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Gavin Hughes and I am a passionate Creative Engineer!
                    I love creating games, being hands on, and developing unique solutions to strange problems!
                    I also deeply enjoy spending time with friends, watching YouTube videos, and a bit of acting!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up in the Texas Coastal Bend Area and will graduate from the University of Texas at Austin
                    as a Mechanical Engineering Major with an Elements of Computing Certificate and a minor in Entrepreneurship!

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I'm sure you will see looking around, I create many projects in different interests
                        which I try and collect together to show on my YouTube Channel and now on this website as well!
                        I'm also very curious by nature and would love to hear about other people's projects,

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanging out with my friends is a great way I spend my time
                            whether it be on Discord playing Lethal Company or Minecraft or hanging out in person
                            going to the local Spirit Halloween or celebrating a Birthday! You can always count on
                            friends to lift you up after a stressful day.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of my friends right now are in my theater org,
                            but I still hold some from back in high school and hope to find more as I go through life.
                            Each have their own stories, experiences, and skills
                            that I deeply enjoy hearing about and supporting them when they need it.
                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may not at all times have a large amount of friends, but that's the way I like it with
                            a chosen few close to me as I go through life! I would not be where I am without them and their support!

                            or even vlogging the projects I work on!

                            I've participated in theater on and off since junior high and the people and the laughs
                            are what I always come back for! Everyone there always arrives on their A-game and bring
                            so much energy and wackiness to every rehearsal.
                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the University Theatre Guild, I've participated in 5 Children's Shows
                            and my first musical: Trail to Oregon! One the best plays I've seen and been apart of! 🐂
                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will I continue theater once I've graduated? Who knows? It always
                            somehow creeps back into my life and I meet some amazing people!

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyday, anytime I work, I am guaranteed to be listening to music!
                            It gets me in the groove and helps me focus on the task I'm doing. Even right now I'm listening to music,
                            specifically The Struts!

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My music tastes have changed over the years from popular pop and 
                            alternative rock, to video game soundtracks and fan songs, to some emotional songs
                            about growing up and life as we know it.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my favorite artists over the years have been
                            Imagine Dragons, Or3o, Derivakat, Gooseworx, and The Living Tombstone.
                            The Living Tombstone being my favorite as I tried to achieve the #1 spot on Spotify Wrapped
                            the same year I saw them perform live in Austin!

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite game I would have to say is Minecraft.
                            I've played it since I was a child on my tablet and still keep up with it to this day
                            even though I'm not able to play it as much.
                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Wednesday, I keep on eye out for the latest Minecraft snapshot update
                            to see what's new for features, optimizations, and developer features. Here's to hoping that
                            they eventually allow full creative freedom of their game through Datapacks!
                            I would love to take on a creative project modifying the game to what I desire!
                            I've already collected a list of ideas... 👀

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a Mechanical Engineer has been a dream of mine
                    since elementary school when first asked what career I would be interested in.
                    The ability to be hands on designing a problem to a solution inundated with creativity
                    and problem solving sounds like the perfect place for me!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, I went into University to learn Mechanical Engineering
                    and man has there been some ups and downs. However, being here has given me the perfect place
                    to learn and hone my skills! Below is a collection of my many engineering projects!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my Senior Design Project class, we worked for
                    <a href="https://www.makeitrainwildfire.com/" target="_blank">Make It Rain Wildfire</a> 
                    to improve upon and invent new systems for an emergency
                    sprinkler system attached to fire hydrants. The goal of this system was to prevent flying embers from
                    wildfires igniting someone's property!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project also included research into the legality, ease of use, installation
                    cost, water usage, and deformation for these systems. A lot for one semester but we were able to pull
                    it all together in the end and develop a new device to attach onto theirs. Our idea was a long-distance
                    remote-controlled valve system that allows for both less manpower to enable/disable these systems and
                    the reduction of water usage due to the electronic system able to now have a timer that can turn the
                    system on and off when the ground is damp enough. We went out to test our design
                    but the water pressure was much higher than anticipated which broke the valve we bought.
                    An unsuccessful test but definitely hoping that all our research and design ideas
                    can go forward into a next iteration allowing this potentially property saving system to be used in
                    devastating wildfires.

                    </div>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my Robot Mechanism Design class, we had to design
                    a complex robot utilizing some of the aspects discussed in class like
                    mechanical advantage and 4 bar systems.
                    For our project, we chose to make an automatic can opener that will rotate the can while
                    using a blade to slowly cut the top off of the can.
                    While the project initially seemed simple, we ended up having to change our designs
                    multiple times due to pushback from the teaching team which ultimately ended up with us
                    going back to our original idea.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea we settled with is using a manually-controlled reverse
                    break-drum clamp to grab the can while it is rotated using a simple gear system. While rotating,
                    the top of the can will be cut using a slider crank that pushes a blade periodically into the can.
                    I wish we didn't get as much pushback during the design phase so we had more time to make more prototypes
                    to test the period of cutting and cutting more towards the top of the can to reduce deformation issues.
                    We also could've made it work for any size cans which was the original goal.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Robotics & Automation Society (RAS), I
                    participated in the Demobots subcommittee where we create multiple subteams
                    to create our own robots to demonstrate during robotics events like UT's STEM Girl Day!
                    My subteam that I headed, Talons of Acquisition (TOA), had the goal of making a
                    simple claw machine meant to be modularized and improved throughout its lifetime.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This robot unfortunately has taken the longest to make
                    simply due to the nature of the subcommittee being low-commitment, however, it has
                    been the most fun as I've got to meet so many cool and unique friends throughout my
                    4 years on the team! I ended up being the main mechanical engineer designing and
                    manufacturing a lot of the subsystems pictured. Before I left, we had begun work
                    on some of the electrical and software aspects of the design and hope to keep
                    in contact with the team past graduation! I also can't wait to see the design
                    fully finished and demonstrated to inspire other students and youth!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I signed up for a Battle Bots competition! You heard that right!
                    Within a couple months, we had to design, build, and battle our own bots in a
                    double-elimination bracket.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was the main one on CAD and designed the body of the bot.
                    A couple design factors I thought crucial for the body is: 1. Being able to be flipped
                    over which is why the body isn't that tall so the wheels could stick out on either side
                    and 2. Having a secondary offense mechanism of a ramp.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most difficult parts was getting the weapon machined
                    as MechE's Machine Shop Staff was incredibly unhelpful however someone from Texas Inventionworks helped
                    us out. Unfortunately, our motor ended up being flipped for the weapon which caused it to self-destruct.
                    HOWEVER, my ramp design worked, and we won a battle while we fixed our main weapon.
                    We ended up winning 5th overall! My next semester we ended up building the same robot for our
                    Design Methodology class and did a lot of improvements and analysis to the design.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my Machine Elements class, our task was to design,
                    test, and race an RC car. This proved to be quite the challenge due to us
                    having to design a gearbox and turning mechanism from scratch with little
                    help from the professor and TAs.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a lot of research and prototyping we were able to come up with the
                    design shown here. As this class also discussed deflection and fatigue, we did
                    an FEA analysis both for the axle and upon impact as well as hand calculations for
                    different stress conditions.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our analysis results and not wanting to damage our steering
                    mechanism, we added a front ramming bar to protect ourselves. Unfortunately, during
                    competition our servo horn got stripped and we had to quickly replace it but we could only
                    turn right which was the opposite way of the track. Shows how important
                    quality assurance is and how to design a better steering mechanism for next time!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day I decided, today I'm going to build my own robot and so I did!
                    I was inspired by the 
                    <a href="https://shop.knexusergroup.org.uk/products/71050" target="_blank">K'NEX Spider Bot</a> 
                    toy I has as a child and wanted to recreate it using the lasercutters and printers I was now
                    trained for at Texas Inventionworks.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I modeled it in Fusion360 as it's the CAD software I was most familar with at the time and then
                    built and assembled it within the span of a semester. The thing I unnexpectedly had the most trouble
                    with was the servos as I accidentally bought limited 180° servos, so I had to take them apart
                    and unattach the potentiometer.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After building it, I showed to my friends to see how they would respond to it as
                    I had put two sound sensors on the front but the robot ended up being too loud and too slow for the
                    sounds sensors to do anything. Next time could be interesting to try it with distance sensors and have it stop
                    every couple seconds to sense motion and move towards it. Watch my
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/M6HiwVCEiQA" target="_blank">YouTube Vlog</a> for more details!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one of my first classes in university, I was tasked with
                    designing, fabricating, and making a full report for a fidget spinner project.
                    This involved sending sketches, bill of materials, conducting an FEA analysis of a
                    drop test, and setting up a CAM operation to create a mold for the fidget spinners.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the designing of the Fidget Spinner, I was tasked with
                    learning and using Solidworks which deemed to be a lot more challenging than anticipated
                    with the organic shape I had in mind. The sketches and FEA tests
                    were done in Solidworks with the CAM setup being done in Fusion360.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central piece was 3D printed and friction fit
                    with the main body being made using injection molding. It suprisingly turned out exactly
                    how I planned and I never had to sacrifice the design due to it being too complicated
                    for any of the processes the assignments asked for.

                    I originally had no interest in the subject as I thought all it entailed
                    was sitting at a desk all day to create programs to run numbers.
                    That was until... I discovered the world of Game Development and found it was all worth it!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first tried out creating Snake on my TI-84 calculator and seeing my classmates reactions
                    sparked a whole new world of interest for me as I now search for any and all types of challenges
                    in the software and game development sphere!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jumble Jam Game Jam was quite an interesting game jam concept
                    where you work on 3 games across 24 hours each as the game gets sent over to the next team.
                    Unfortunately, the next 2 games we were sent were 3D games meaning it was mainly me able to
                    work on the game and the games also had no clear vision, so...
                    I present to you 3 whole game ideas I designed and made within 72 hours!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penguin Fight is an interesting take on a rhythm fighting game where
                    each move is given rhythmically in the song and then executed on by the enemy in this case Obi-Wan!
                    Penguin Finder was very much open sandbox for us in terms of you had to find and return 5 different
                    penguin statues. My favorite room is the dark room where you have to use a scanning feature like in the
                    game
                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/475190/Scanner_Sombre/" target="_blank">Scanner Sombre</a>.
                    The third game is Save the Penguins! where you must guide the penguins
                    to a safe shelter before the storm but the penguins have a bit of a mind of their own and the terrain
                    is very slippery!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've had the idea for a while now to create some type of Superhero VR Game!
                    Now, while yes, there have been some before they don't get into that much depth and I think there is
                    a lot of untapped potential especially if multiplayer is involved as you would have to uniquely work
                    together with others to solve complex problems.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact plan for the game is not yet set in stone but after having
                    started the project making the classic web-swinging behavior, some ideas have started to form
                    in terms of where this game could go utilizing my favorite game mechanic, ecosystems!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is not yet finished, so check back later!
                    <div style="display: none;">
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A superhero VR game sounds super exciting yet where to go with it
                        is a very interesting questions I've pondered for a while. However, after some more thought,
                        realizing what game mechanics I enjoy creating, and consuming of some more media for inspiration
                        I've begun to piece something together that could be quite interesting!
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is still in its infancy and not finalized yet but having a superhero
                        game focused more on the detective work especially in a working ecosystem similar to both recently watched
                        Avatar shows sounds like something I could definitely plan and achieve with the balance of elements and
                        the public reputation, training and learning of new skills through practice and investigation, and being
                        a detective learning the source of "evil." However, of course, like I said still in its infancy as a lot
                        of the interesting ideas sound very similar to exactly being Avatar and while could have different elements,
                        ect., it does need more to distinguish it from the franchise.

                    </div>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mysterious game called Multiplayer Madness! The idea for this game
                    is inspired by a lot of Minecraft content and other player to player based interactions I've
                    seen from games based on storytelling and adventure.
                    It's also one of the three game I've been working on as a part of my initiative to learn how to use Unreal!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main focus is focusing player interactions amongst an island with
                    random trials, objects, and interactions meant to create interesting storytelling beats dynamically
                    which may seem challenging but what's programming without a bit of a challenge!
                    There is also a focus again on exploration as you can explore the dangerous lands outside of the island to
                    get specific materials and do specific tasks. This project is also meant to be procedural with terrain building/destruction!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Texas Game Jam is a jam I've competed in every year
                    at UT. It's hosted by the Electronic Game Developer Society (EGaDS) and is a whole
                    lot of fun each time! It's great working with a team of very talented people to
                    be able to pull off an interesting game within 24 hours!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first year we made
                    <a href="https://insighted.itch.io/vertices-and-pi" target="_blank">Vertices and Pi</a> 
                    in Unity which contains
                    a collection of cool minigames all tied up in a sweet story, second year we got a bit
                    too ambitious by trying to make a 3D Unreal game which didn't get fully finished, third year
                    we went with Godot and made
                    <a href="https://redengdeveloper.itch.io/rat-tide-skirmish" target="_blank">Rat-Tide Skirmish</a> 
                    which is a 2 vs. 2 fighting game where you throw traps
                    at each other and run along the walls, and finally the forth year we went back to Unity and
                    made
                    <a href="https://redengdeveloper.itch.io/tango-to-the-end-of-time" target="_blank">Tango to the End of Time</a> 
                    which is an extremely challenging physics-based timing game
                    where you have to catapult yourself around planets to the end. Overall, super fun and exciting working on these
                    great small games! Will jam with some of the people I've worked with again!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Virtual Robot Simulator is a program that I have worked on for a while.
                    It originally started as a personal project to bring the experience of the robotics competition FTC
                    to a virtual environment during Covid times, however, a respresentative from FTC was making their
                    own simulator and asked me to join the team after seeing my skills and initiative!
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The Virtual Robot Simulator hopes to provide a simulator to those teams in FTC and inspired elementary
                    students who wish to experience the world of robotics! Because of this, we offer the ability to program
                    using Blocks and Java, the ability to start a multiplayer competition between others, lessons ranging
                    from beginner to advanced topics, and the ability to import your own robots that have been made through
                    a CAD software which I have been in charge of designing and creating! I've also worked a lot on the visual
                    design and ensuring a smooth user experience for new users. Overall, a very rewarding experience as the
                    problems are complicated, the user experience is important, and the program has had an active
                    positive impact for many users and elementary schools!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next augmented reality project, Plants vs. Zombies!
                    I was inspired by seeing my favorite games be turned into AR projects like Five
                    Nights at Freddy's and Minecraft and while both projects unfortunately failed, it gave
                    me a lot of ideas on how to fix them and made me realize the perfect franchise to take
                    up the mantel as the next Pokemon Go phenomenon!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Plants vs. Zombies augmented reality game mostly speaks
                    for itself, but some extra cool features involve adding a multiplayer feature where
                    you and others can all defend the same lawn against a ZOMBOSS, having to travel to certain biomes
                    around your neighborhood to get special plants, and having custom AR minigames like the first
                    Plants vs. Zombies game that utilizes the new tech. While I already made a demo, I kind of
                    want to make a more fleshed out demo and play in a multiplayer Zomboss battle for the fun of it!

                    I have to show off the amount of prototyping and calculations I did to make
                    the "ultimate" autonomous program! This challenge involved a 30 second time period
                    to score the most points possible with a 2 vs. 2 team.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I implemented a system that would take in coordinate points for the
                    robot to go along a designated path that would dynamically change based on system parameters
                    and the randomization of the field. This was checked using encoder wheels, distance sensors,
                    and an Intertial Measurement Unit (IMU) which can be seen in the first picture. I then implemented
                    2 systems for the drivers including wheel locking so we wouldn't be pushed while launching rings
                    and an automatic alignment and correct power set to launch the rings reliably into the top goal!
                    Overall, a very fun programming challenge that combined both of my favorite subjects!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SirenHead Augmented Reality Experience was very much a random
                    idea I had in the peak of SirenHead popularity, but since I know I'd be able to create it
                    easily and quickly as well as trying out augmented reality for the first time I decided
                    to create a fully working experience!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I say experience because you don't do anything besides set it up
                    and watch but the details are what I'm most proud of. I created the short story, animations,
                    the rope physics for the power lines, and the particle systems! It all came together really well
                    and has got me excited to try out more AR tech on my phone I recently got just to be able to
                    create these types of things! I also include it here as it's my most downloaded Itch.io application!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another game that originally started as a game jam,
                    but turns out became really fun to play, Villain REWIND! I played this game a lot in my classes during
                    quarantine to pass the time once assignments were done.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this game, you must continuously reach the end of the same room as you are rewound back,
                    however, the position of the player is tracked every run and, in beat with the song, a trap will be placed
                    where the player has been before which makes the player not be able to take the same path twice and
                    will lead to eventual chaos with traps down every single path. This game requires a lot of quick thinking
                    and has been very fun to try and beat on my "impossible" mode where the time to get through the room each time
                    is very small and the amount of times you have to run through is very large.
                    I've enjoyed it so much and have been inspired by a Gooseworx song to make a bigger release of it on the fabled Unreal Engine!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game Conquer the Tree I originally won as part of a Game Jam
                    contest! The company offered to publish a fully finished version of my game on their website
                    so I went straight to work. This specific company's platform allows a multiplayer couch experience
                    where you can control the game through players' phones which I thought was a cool concept!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game involves a dynamically created board based on a growing tree where
                    you must be the first to eat leaves and acorns to earn points! The only way to be the first one to move is
                    by moving the least amount of spaces per round which makes it an interesting game dynamic. For the full game,
                    powerups and minigames were included that resemble classic games like snake, whac-a-mole,
                    and a few originals like an acorn launching game. It has also gone through a couple publishing platforms
                    as the original platform vanished and the previous one became corporate and booted multiple indie games,
                    so eventually I hope to publish it again using my own technology to host it!

                    sprinkler system attached to fire hydrants. The goal of this system is to prevent flying embers from
                    wildfires igniting someone's property!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indicator Demonstrator was made for a class project!
                    We were told to make some type of demonstration showing off some aspect of
                    the PH scale that we've learned. I decided to make a game out of it
                    which I don't always do for class projects with how large games can quickly become,
                    but I'm really proud of this one!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have included a science section to show off a lot of the
                    research I did including finding which compounds would best fit for the game to make
                    sure I got a good range. For the game, you must match the compound to the corresponding
                    color a PH strip type indicator would show if exposed to this compound. This then repeats
                    until the end where I implemented a scoreboard feature for the first time which was quite fun
                    so then I could compete with my friends! Never could do well though because of my color-blindness.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space Fighters! My first experience in the top down shooter variety as well
                    as in the multiplayer games sphere which was the main motivation for designing the game! I wanted to
                    design a game that was both cooperative as well as competitive where both players' goal is to collect
                    resources, defeat waves of enemies, and finally defeat a random boss.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    I learned a lot from this game specifically in what types of game experiences I deeply enjoy creating.
                    I liked having a multiplayer aspect to where I could play and have fun with my friends and hopefully be
                    able to see others having fun in an experience I had created. It also showed me that I liked creating
                    different enemy AI. It's a weird combination of putting yourself in the enemies perspective and throwing
                    everything you got at them while having the player figure out their patterns and weaknesses to be able
                    to take out the enemy while not making it seem like the game revolves around the player in a type of ecosystem.
                    I may come back to the game to this game at some point, especially since I made a crab-based version of this
                    game for one of my classes recently!

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project that started it all, and yes, it is a fan game for Jacksepticeye.
                    I started this project because I wanted to begin learning programming and game development
                    and my hope was along the way, it would get noticed, and I would be able to create more games off of its success!
                    I decided to use Unity as it is free to use and from what I heard easy to learn. With only having programmed
                    small programs from Google Blockly and some games on my TI-84 Calculator, it seemed like the perfect place to begin!
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game was a 2.5D side-scroller, adventure game where you explore the town and capture each alternate
                    persona of Jacksepticeye in different minigames with the idea of eventually having 3 other side stories included in the game
                    with other popular content creators acting as the stars. This game was never fully finished or successful,
                    but I learned a lot about Unity and many of the future chapters' ideas have inspired my other games and storylines!
